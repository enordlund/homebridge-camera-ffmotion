Still working on adding the motion sensor.
• Possibly move the part in the constructor to the didFinishLaunching loop.
• Change MotionCameraAccessory to use motionConfig for input, rather than the generic config file?
• Figure out how to set the source for MotionCameraAccessory in this loop format
    • Investigate the new Accessory() thing in didFinishLaunching, & compare to h-c-m addition approach with source things.


It currently compiles if I don't add the motion accessory in accessories().
